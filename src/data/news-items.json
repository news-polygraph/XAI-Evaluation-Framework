Tucker Carlson had the former mayor of Shiloh, Israel on his show this past week to talk about the blazing success of Israel’s border wall with Egypt. 55,000 illegal aliens from poor African countries had snuck into Israel in one year, which is a huge number for such a tiny geographic area. As the rates of rape, murder, burglary, grand theft auto and dynamited ATM machines skyrocketed, Israel’s government opted to build a wall on its border. One of the most disgusting elements of our lack of a wall on our southern border is the fact that most of the Americans who originally demanded a border wall – have been dead for many years! Mexico’s Revolutionary War lasted from 1910 to 1920. It was during those years of bloody, violent conflict amid our dysfunctional southern neighbors that Americans began asking Congress to build a wall to keep Mexico’s problems on Mexico’s side of the border. Meanwhile, data compiled by NCFIRE (North Carolinians for Immigration Reform and Enforcement) reveals that the state of North Carolina has arrested an average of 18 illegal aliens every month this year for the crime of child rape. Statistically, this means that the 50 states in America are on track to arrest 10,800 illegal aliens for raping children in 2018. And that 10,800 figure is a bare-minimum, super-generous, giving-the-illegal-alien-child-rapists-the-benefit-of-the-doubt number. A total of 10,800 arrests assumes that each illegal alien child rapist only rapes one child in America. Many will rape three, four, or a dozen before they are caught, so the “true” number could be in the 30,000 to 40,000 raped children range. Just out of curiosity, we would love to hear what Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi’s cutoff number would be. If 10,800 raped children in America is not enough to make them desire a wall on our southern border, where is the line? Would 20,000 child rapes be too many? How about 50,000?

Moreover, the military has charged Gates with masterminding a child trafficking ring, which he ran with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. As reported by RRN on 20 May, U.S. Navy Seals operating under JAG authority stormed Gates’ 492-acre ranch in northwest Wyoming and discovered a subterranean bunker where children had been temporarily housed prior to being sold into slavery. An SD card recovered at the scene showed a young girl in pajamas handcuffed to a bed and crying out for her mother. Off camera, a maniacal Gates could be heard encouraging the child to dress in high heels and lingerie so she could better please her “new mommy and daddy.” Sources told RRN that Gates’ wife Melinda played a crucial role in his arrest. “Initially she was reluctant to fully cooperate, because she felt that knowledge of her involvement might jeopardize the fortune she aims to get from the divorce settlement, most of which has not been paid. But JAG has evidence proving that she had knowledge of the child trafficking and told her she’d be charged alongside Bill if she didn’t cooperate. It turned out that Bill had been spamming her with enciphered emails only she could decode. He wanted to reconcile.
